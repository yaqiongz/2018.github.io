title: Tackling job searching frustration
---


Last night, I joined a cheeky scientist association webniar about tackling job search frustration.

I agree that there'are a lot people get hired last December, this makes those who did not get hired even more anxious.

In the webinar, the hoster invites three guests to talk about their experience, mostly talk about the darkest time they have during their job search process.

They also gave suggestions on how to tackle those dark days, I can recall some of them:
1. Apply for multiple jobs. So when one turns out not working, go ahead for the next one.
2. Most of the phds in the association have no industry experience, but don't be afraid to apply for jobs. Since phds are trained to learn things and learn fast.
3. The company want to hire a person, not a piece of resume. So instead of making your resume perfect, connect with people in the company.

All those suggestions are pretty helpful for me at this time.I missed some small part of the webinar. I will go back to check the vedio when it's available in their website.
