title: Building iceberg classification models with Keras
---

This is my first capstone project in Springboard. And this is a on-going Kaggle competition when I worked on this project. I have done most part of the project.

By working on this project, I've learnt a lot. 

1. The most important part is that from reading and understing others' code. For example, some of the code are built nicely with structured functions, and some of them have use very neat sytax for a perticular line of code. 

2. I also gained python skills by acheiving a lot of small goal, such as visualize the image with subplots, try different filters, optimize the cross validation report styles, and so on. 

3. When doing this project, I found AWS EC2 instance with deep learning AMI handy.
