title: Building iceberg classification models with Keras
---

*This is my capstone project #1 in Springboard. And this is a on-going [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge) when I worked on this project.*

Here is the link for the full report: [Link](https://github.com/yaqiongz/aws/blob/master/FinalReport/FinalR_AWS.ipynb)


There are so many new images generated every second, from the smart phones by our hand, and from the radar in the sky. Letting a computer understanding images is useful, yet not easy. It's also interesting to recall the moments we teach our children apples and pears from those image cards. Human's brains are certainly different, but they also need to initiate the learning process. Now, is it a good time to initiate the learning of a computer?

In this kaggle chanllenge project, we want to let a computer tell icebergs and ships from remote sensors' image data with better performance. The teaching materials is a training dataset contains about 1600 image data. Those data are marked with the label if the images contain an iceberg or not. And then, after building the model from the training data, the model will predict new images and the performance of prediction will be evaluated. 


### Acknowledgements: 
I would like to thank my mentor Aaron for his help, such as giving me suggestions what model to use, explaining CV to me, helping connecting with AWS and giving me suggestions for future work (building machine learning framework, building data pipeline, connecting with available API, etc.). 

I also want to thank the community in Kaggle. The most important part of my learning so far is reading and understing others' code. For example, some of the code are built nicely with structured functions, and some of them have used neat sytax for a perticular line of code. I wouldn't build my python skills as fast if I didn't read those nice posts in Kaggle kernels.
