title: Building iceberg classification models with Keras
---

*This is my capstone project #1 in Springboard. And this is a on-going [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge) when I worked on this project.*

There is the link for the full report: [Link](https://github.com/yaqiongz/aws/blob/master/FinalReport/FinalR_AWS.ipynb)

### Acknowledgements: 
I would like to thank my mentor Aaron for his helpï¼Œ such as giving me suggestions what model to use, explain CV to me, helping connecting with AWS and giving me suggestions for future work (building machine learning framework, building dta pipeline, connecting with API, etc.). 

I also want to thank the community in Kaggle. The most important part is that from reading and understing others' code. For example, some of the code are built nicely with structured functions, and some of them have use very neat sytax for a perticular line of code. I would not build my python skills as fast if I do not read others posts.
