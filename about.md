Hi, I'm Yaqiong. I studied carbon nanotubes chemical sensors in my phd life in the University of Utah. 

Later, I decided I want to become a data scienitst. Why? 

Reasons:
- I enjoy researching and understanding things. And I can use data science as a tool to understanding social phenomenons, testing scientifical hypothesis, and marketing problems.

- I love building things. A data scientist have the potential to building data products, such as search engine, recommendation system, and data piplines.
